## [12. Program to find number of squares in a chessboard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-find-number-of-squares-on-a-chessboard/)


# Solution 

## 1) Math - OPTIMAL

       To avoid overflow, we first calculate n*(n+1)/2 and then multiply it with (2*n+1)/3.
      
      
   ### Code : (.cpp)
    
          long long int countSquares(int n) {
              return (n * (n + 1) / 2) * (2 * n + 1) / 3;
          }

 
      Time Complexity  : O(1) 
                         Since it takes constant time.
      Space Complexity : O(1)
                         Since no extra space is used.
